      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

Snakes that are milked include cobras, mambas, vipers, asps, corals, copperheads, kraits, sea snakes and rattlesnakes.</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #00ff00;">HOW MUCH WOULD I MAKE!?!??!</span><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">AROUND 30,000$$ ANNUALLY!</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">WHERE DO YOU WORK!!!</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Snake milker who works in the field will find employment at a “serpentarium”. This is a type of lab that houses and researches snakes and other related venomous reptiles. The lab itself may also have other duties such as conservation, breeding, research, rehabilitation and veterinarian services.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">ARE THERE ANY PREREQUISITES????!?!?!??!</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Snake milking is a niche area but one with clear education path. High school students will need strong grades in math and biology. Chemistry will be helpful too to understand the chemical properties of the venom.</span></strong></p>
